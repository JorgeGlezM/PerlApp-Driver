    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=12:38:C6:38:25:F0:47:5C:C4:35:C5:B7:9B:C7:E3:43:77:71:B8:38%3Bcom.example.perlappdriver

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.example.perlappdriver

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    12:38:C6:38:25:F0:47:5C:C4:35:C5:B7:9B:C7:E3:43:77:71:B8:38

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
